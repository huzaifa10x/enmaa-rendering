                        Enmaa Engineering Consultant brings sought-after expertise to design-build projects. We collaborate with contractors to create effective value engineering ideas and creatively-designed solutions. Our solutions are aimed at improving the end result of the project. When working in a design-build configuration, we take our technical capabilities and construction experience and utilize them to improve designs for constructability, cost, and schedule. We establish project lifecycle schedules that account for design, procurement, and construction. While doing this, we are always focused on managing costs within the schedule.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-foreground text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Design-build project delivery methods rely on disciplined teamwork between designers and contractors from day one of the project. This helps in creating opportunities for innovation that are impossible with traditional approaches. Design engineers work alongside contractor personnel to obtain the best design alternatives and workflows. They assess how the work might be constructed, and create opportunities for value improvements.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-foreground text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        As part of this process, we perform a constructability review. This way we identify challenges associated with executing the design early on. When the cost to make a change is less than in the field. Design-build project delivery minimizes expensive construction modifications by encouraging concurrent construction and design proceeds. With value engineering expertise, we will always find ways to reduce cost and improve schedules. We will increase performance without compromising quality. By tracking costs and monitoring schedules, we provide early warning of potential issues. This allows for rapid decision making to increase the delivery of value.
