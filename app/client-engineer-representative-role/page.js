                        communications and collaboration processes. Our representatives take an inclusive
                        approach to project interface management. They work directly with designers,

                        Client Engineer representation requires technical capability, business sense, and
                        diplomacy when working to advance the client&apos;s interests while accommodating
                        competing or conflicting interests. Our representatives participate in planning,
                        budgeting, and procurement to ensure technical considerations are provided
                        appropriate weight in business decisions. We monitor contractor performance and
                        evaluate change orders. We provide technical advice to protect the client&apos;s
                        interests. Enmaa has a demonstrated history of always completing projects on time
                        or better than the scheduled completion dates.

                        Our representatives are dedicated to continuously observing (on and off site) the
                        schedule, costs, and quality assurance parameters to identify opportunities to
                        optimize schedule and costs or address challenges before they escalate. This
